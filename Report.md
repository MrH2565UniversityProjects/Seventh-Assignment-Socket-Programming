# Data Format Analysis

## Question 1: Pipe-Delimited Format (`|`)

### 1. Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Simple to implement and easy to use

**Cons:**
- Not standardized (can cause inconsistencies)
- Risk of parsing errors if the delimiter (`|`) appears in the data

### 2. Parsing Method
- Basic parsing can be done using `.split("|")`
- **Problem:** If the data itself contains `|`, parsing fails

### 3. Suitability for Complex Data
**No**, it's inefficient for:
- **Nested data** (increases risk of delimiter conflicts)
- **Large datasets** (slower parsing due to manual checks)

## Question 2: Serialized Objects

### 1. Data Transmission
- The entire object is sent as a serialized stream
- **No need** for manual delimiters

### 2. Compatibility Issues
**Not always reliable** because:
- Different systems may use different serialization/deserialization methods
- Can result in corrupted or misinterpreted data

## Question 3: JSON Format

### 1. Advantages
**Widely adopted standard** for data exchange
**Human-readable** and easy to parse

### 2. Cross-Language Support
**Yes**, JSON works across languages:
- Each language parses data according to its own rules
- **No need** for custom serialization methods
